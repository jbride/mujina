## Please start with a Discussion instead

Issues in this project are created by maintainers after a topic has been
discussed and confirmed. This helps ensure all issues are actionable and
ready to be worked on.

**To report a bug, suggest a feature, or ask a question:**
1. Visit our [Discussions page](https://github.com/mujina/mujina-miner/discussions/new/choose)
2. Choose the appropriate category
3. Fill out the template

Once your discussion reaches a point where there's a clear, actionable item,
a maintainer will create an issue for it.

Thank you for understanding!
