# BM13xx Protocol Documentation

This document describes the serial communication protocol used by the BM13xx 
family of Bitcoin mining ASICs. Since manufacturer documentation is not publicly 
available, this represents our best understanding based on analyzing open-source 
implementations and reverse engineering efforts.

## Sources

- ESP-miner BM1370 implementation
- CGMiner driver implementations
- Emberone-miner BM1362/BM1368 implementation

## Overview

The BM13xx family (BM1362, BM1370, etc.) uses a frame-based 
serial protocol for communication between the host and mining ASICs. The 
protocol supports both command/response patterns and asynchronous nonce 
reporting.

### Chip Architecture

Different chips in the BM13xx family have varying core architectures:

- **BM1362**: Core count unknown (used in Antminer S19 series)
- **BM1370**: 80 main cores × 16 sub-cores = 1,280 total hashing units

The core architecture affects how nonces are reported and job IDs are encoded.

## Frame Format

All frames follow this basic structure:
```
| Preamble | Type/Flags | Length | Payload | CRC |
```

### Command Frames (Host → ASIC)
- **Preamble**: `0x55 0xAA` (2 bytes)
- **Type/Flags**: 1 byte encoding type, broadcast flag, and command
- **Length**: 1 byte total frame length
- **Payload**: Variable length data
- **CRC**: CRC5 for commands, CRC16 for jobs

### Response Frames (ASIC → Host)
- **Preamble**: `0xAA 0x55` (2 bytes, reversed from commands)
- **Payload**: Response-specific data
- **CRC**: CRC5 in last byte (bits 0-4), with response type in bits 5-7

## Byte Order (Endianness)

**All multi-byte values in the BM13xx protocol use little-endian byte order.**

This means for multi-byte values:
- The least significant byte (LSB) is transmitted first
- The most significant byte (MSB) is transmitted last

Examples:
- 16-bit value `0x1234` → transmitted as `[0x34, 0x12]`
- 32-bit value `0x12345678` → transmitted as `[0x78, 0x56, 0x34, 0x12]`

Affected fields:
- **16-bit values**: version, chip_id, CRC16
- **32-bit values**: nonce, nbits, ntime, register values

Special cases:
- **chip_id in responses**: The 2-byte chip_id field that appears in all read 
register responses should be treated as a fixed byte sequence `[0x13, 0x70]` 
rather than as an integer value
- **Hash values** (merkle_root, prev_block_hash): These are byte arrays that 
should be transmitted as-is without endianness conversion
- **Single bytes**: No endianness applies (job_id, midstate_num, etc.)

## Command Types

The Type/Flags byte (3rd byte in command frames) encodes multiple fields:

```
Bit 7: TYPE (0=command, 1=work)  
Bit 6: BROADCAST (0=single chip, 1=all chips)
Bit 5: Always 0
Bits 4-0: CMD value
```

Common Type/Flags values:
- `0x42` = TYPE=0, BROADCAST=0, CMD=2 (read register from specific chip)
- `0x41` = TYPE=0, BROADCAST=0, CMD=1 (write register to specific chip)
- `0x51` = TYPE=0, BROADCAST=1, CMD=1 (write register to all chips)
- `0x21` = TYPE=1, BROADCAST=0, CMD=1 (send work/job)

### Read Register (CMD=2)
Reads a 4-byte register from the ASIC.

**Request Format:**
```
| 0x55 0xAA | Type/Flags | Length | Chip_Addr | Reg_Addr | CRC5 |
```
- Length: Always `0x05` (5 bytes excluding preamble)
- Type/Flags: `0x42` for specific chip (broadcast reads would cause bus 
collisions)
- Example: `55 AA 42 05 00 00 1C` (read register 0x00 from chip at address 
0x00)

### Write Register (CMD=1)
Writes a 4-byte value to a register.

**Request Format:**
```
| 0x55 0xAA | Type/Flags | Length | Chip_Addr | Reg_Addr | Data[4] | CRC5 |
```
- Length: Always `0x09` (9 bytes excluding preamble)
- Type/Flags: `0x51` for broadcast, `0x41` for specific chip
- Example: `55 AA 51 09 00 A4 90 00 FF FF 1C` (broadcast write 0xFF009090 to 
register 0xA4)

### Mining Job (TYPE=1, CMD=1)

BM13xx chips support two job formats, determined by the chip model and version 
rolling requirements:

1. **Full Format**: Used by BM1362/BM1370 - ASIC calculates midstates
2. **Midstate Format**: Used by BM1397 and others - Host pre-calculates midstates

#### Full Format (BM1362/BM1370)
The ASIC calculates SHA256 midstates internally from the provided block header 
components. This format is used by the chips mujina-miner supports.

**Request Format:**
```
| 0x55 0xAA | 0x21 | Length | Job_Data | CRC16 |
```
- **Preamble**: `0x55 0xAA` (2 bytes)
- **Type/Flags**: `0x21` = TYPE=1 (work), BROADCAST=0, CMD=1
- **Length**: `0x56` (86 decimal) = 82 bytes job_data + 2 bytes CRC16 + 2 bytes 
for type/length
- **Job_Data**: 82 bytes of mining work (see below)
- **CRC16**: 16-bit CRC calculated over type/flags + length + job_data

**Job_Data Structure (82 bytes):**
```
| job_header | num_midstates | starting_nonce[4] | nbits[4] | ntime[4] | 
merkle_root[32] | prev_block_hash[32] | version[4] |
```
- **job_header** (1 byte): Identifies this job for nonce responses
  - Contains 4-bit job_id in bits 6-3
- **num_midstates** (1 byte): Number of midstates (always 0x01 for BM1370)
  - ESP-miner hardcodes this to 0x01 regardless of version rolling
  - Version rolling is actually controlled by register 0xA4 (VERSION_MASK)
  - This field may be vestigial for chips using full format
- **starting_nonce** (4 bytes): Starting nonce value (always 0x00000000)
- **nbits** (4 bytes): Encoded difficulty target (little-endian)
  - Example: 0x170E3AB4 → transmitted as [0xB4, 0x3A, 0x0E, 0x17]
- **ntime** (4 bytes): Block timestamp (little-endian)
  - Unix timestamp
- **merkle_root** (32 bytes): Root of transaction merkle tree
  - SHA256 hash, transmitted as-is (no endianness conversion)
- **prev_block_hash** (32 bytes): Hash of previous block
  - SHA256 hash, transmitted as-is (no endianness conversion)
- **version** (4 bytes): Block version (little-endian)
  - Example: 0x20000000 → transmitted as [0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x20]
  - Lower bits may be modified if version rolling enabled

**Example Job Packet:**
```
55 AA 21 56                              # Preamble + Type + Length
18                                       # job_header (job_id = 3)
01                                       # num_midstates = 1
00 00 00 00                              # starting_nonce
B4 3A 0E 17                              # nbits
5C 8B 67 67                              # ntime
[32 bytes merkle_root]                   # merkle_root
[32 bytes prev_block_hash]               # prev_block_hash  
00 00 00 20                              # version
XX XX                                    # CRC16
```
Total: 88 bytes (2 preamble + 1 type + 1 length + 82 job_data + 2 CRC16)

#### Midstate Format (Not Used by mujina-miner)

Some BM13xx chips (like BM1397) require the host to pre-calculate SHA256 
midstates for version rolling. In this format:
- The host calculates different midstates for each version variation
- Job packet includes 1-4 pre-calculated midstates (32 bytes each)
- Enables more efficient version rolling on the ASIC
- Total packet size varies based on number of midstates

Since BM1362/BM1370 calculate midstates internally, mujina-miner uses 
the full format exclusively. Version rolling is controlled by register 0xA4 
(VERSION_MASK), not by the `num_midstates` field.

## Response Types

### Read Register Response (TYPE=0)
**Format (11 bytes total):**
```
| 0xAA 0x55 | Register_Value[4] | Chip_Addr | Reg_Addr | Unknown[2] | 
CRC5+Type |
```

- **Register_Value**: 4-byte value read from the register
- **Chip_Addr**: Address of the responding chip
- **Reg_Addr**: Address of the register that was read
- **Unknown**: 2 bytes of unknown purpose
- **CRC5+Type**: Last byte with CRC5 in bits 0-4 and response type (0) in bits 
5-7

Example response for reading register 0x00 (CHIP_ID):
- Command: `55 AA 52 05 00 00 0A`
- Response: `AA 55 13 70 00 00 00 00 00 00 10`
  - Register_Value: `13 70 00 00` (contains BM1370 chip ID in first 2 bytes)
  - Chip_Addr: `00`
  - Reg_Addr: `00`
  - Unknown: `00 00`
  - CRC5+Type: `10`

Note: Only register 0x00 read has been captured. The purpose of the 2 unknown 
bytes is not documented.

### Nonce Response (TYPE=4)

**Format (11 bytes total):**
```
| 0xAA 0x55 | Nonce[4] | Midstate_Num | Result_Header | Version[2] | CRC5+Type 
|
```

**Purpose of Core and Job ID Encoding:**
The encoding allows ASICs to:
- Run multiple jobs concurrently (up to 128 different jobs)
- Identify which specific core found a valid nonce (main core + sub-core)
- Match nonces back to their original work assignments
- Support efficient work distribution across all cores

**Field Encoding by Chip Type:**

#### BM1370 (80 cores × 16 sub-cores = 1,280 units):
- **Nonce**: 32-bit nonce value (little-endian)
  - Bits 31-25: Main core ID (7 bits, values 0-79)
  - Bits 24-0: Actual nonce value
- **Midstate_Num**: Chip/core identifier (may encode chip ID in multi-chip 
chains)
- **Result_Header**: 8-bit field containing:
  - Bits 7-4: 4-bit job_id (0-15) 
  - Bits 3-0: 4-bit subcore_id (0-15)
- **Version**: 16-bit version bits (little-endian)
  - When version rolling enabled: Contains rolled bits to be shifted left 13 
positions

Example BM1370 response: `AA 55 18 00 A6 40 02 99 22 F9 91`
- Nonce: 0x40A60018 → Main core 12, nonce value 0x00A60018
- Result_Header: 0x99 → job_id=9 (bits 7-4), subcore_id=9 (bits 3-0)
- Version: 0xF922 → Version bits 0x045F2000 (after shifting)


#### BM1362:
- Similar 11-byte response format
- Job ID encoding likely follows BM1368 pattern
- Midstate_Num may encode chip ID in multi-chip configurations


### Special Response Types

Some nonce responses carry special meanings:

#### Temperature Responses
- Identified by specific job_id values (e.g., 0xB4)
- Nonce field encodes temperature data instead of mining result
- Pattern: `nonce & 0x0000FFFF == 0x00000080`
- Temperature value in upper bytes of nonce field

#### Zero Nonces
- Nonce value 0x00000000 can be valid for non-mining responses
- Always check job_id to determine response type

- **Byte 0-1**: Chip type identifier
  - BM1370: `[0x13, 0x70]`
  - BM1362: `[0x13, 0x62]` (presumed)
- **Byte 2**: Core count or configuration
- **Byte 3**: Chip address (assigned)

Note: The chip type identifier should be treated as a byte sequence rather than
interpreted as an integer value to avoid endianness confusion.

#### 0x08 - PLL_DIVIDER (Frequency Control)
Controls the hash frequency through PLL configuration:
- Byte 0: VCO range (0x50 or 0x40)
- Byte 1: FB_DIV (feedback divider)
- Byte 2: REF_DIV (reference divider)
- Byte 3: POST_DIV flags (bit 1 = fixed to 1)

#### 0x10 - NONCE_RANGE

- Affects how chips divide the 32-bit nonce space
- Different values used for different chip counts
- Mechanism remains partially understood through empirical testing

#### 0x14 - TICKET_MASK (Difficulty)
Sets the difficulty mask (4 bytes, little-endian):
- Each byte is bit-reversed
- Example: difficulty 256 = 0xFF000000 → transmitted as [0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 
0x00]

#### 0x3C - CORE_REGISTER
Requires multiple writes during initialization:
1. Write 0x80008B00

3. Write 0x800082AA (per chip configuration)

#### 0x54 - ANALOG_MUX
Controls analog multiplexer, possibly for temperature sensing:
- BM1370: Write value 0x00000002
- BM1368: Write value 0x00000003
- Purpose not fully documented by manufacturer

#### 0xA4 - VERSION_MASK
Controls which bits of the version field can be rolled:
- Lower 16 bits typically enabled for rolling
- Set via Stratum configuration (e.g., 0x1FFFE000)

#### 0xB9 - MISC_SETTINGS (BM1370 only)
Undocumented miscellaneous settings register:
- Value: 0x00004480
- Written twice during BM1370 initialization
- Not used in other BM13xx variants
- Purpose unknown

## Initialization Sequence

Typical initialization flow for BM13xx chips:

1. **Chip Detection**
   - Write 0x9000A4 to register 0xA4 (reset/enable)
   - Read register 0x00 to get chip_id
   - Verify chip type (0x1370, 0x1362, etc.)

2. **Basic Configuration**
   - Write register 0xA8 with 0x07000007
   - Write register 0x18 with 0x00C100F0 (UART/misc control)
   - Configure register 0x3C with multiple writes

3. **Mining Configuration**
   - Set difficulty via register 0x14
   - Configure version mask via register 0xA4
   - Write register 0x58 with 0x11110100
   - Write register 0xB9 with 0x00004480 (BM1370)
   - Write register 0x54 with 0x00000002 (BM1370)
   - Write register 0xB9 again with 0x00004480 (BM1370)

4. **Frequency Ramping**
   - Start at low frequency (e.g., 56.25 MHz)
   - Gradually increase to target (e.g., 525 MHz)
   - Use register 0x08 for PLL control
   - Small steps ensure stable operation

5. **Baud Rate Change** (optional)
   - Configure registers 0x10 and 0x28
   - Switch UART from 115200 to higher rate (e.g., 1000000)

6. **Chip Addressing** (multi-chip chains)
   - Calculate address interval: `256 / chip_count`
   - Assign addresses: `chip_index * interval`
   - Set via register write commands

## Key Implementation Details

### Job Distribution Across Multiple Chips

In multi-chip mining systems, job distribution works as follows:

#### Chip Addressing
- Each chip in a chain is assigned a unique 8-bit address during initialization
- Addresses are typically spaced evenly (e.g., 0, 4, 8, 12... for a 64-chip 
chain)
- The address determines which portion of the nonce space each chip searches

#### Job Broadcasting
- **The same job is sent to ALL chips in the chain**
- Single broadcast command propagates through the entire chain
- Each chip automatically works on a different portion of the nonce space

#### Nonce Space Partitioning
The 32-bit nonce space (4.3 billion values) is automatically divided:

1. **Between Chips**: Based on chip address and NONCE_RANGE register
   - Chip address influences which nonces are searched
   - NONCE_RANGE register (0x10) further controls distribution
   - No explicit range assignment needed from software

2. **Between Cores**: Within each chip
   - Core ID encoded in upper nonce bits (typically bits 24-31)
   - Each core searches ~33.5 million nonces (4.3B / 128 cores)

3. **Example**: BM1370 with 80 cores × 16 sub-cores
   - Bits 31-25: Main core ID (80 cores)
   - Bits 24-0: Actual nonce value searched
   - Total: 1,280 parallel searches per chip

#### NONCE_RANGE Register Configuration

The NONCE_RANGE register (0x10) uses empirically-determined values to optimize 
nonce distribution. See discussion at: https://github.com/bitaxeorg/ESP-Miner/pull/167

**Known Values (4-byte little-endian):**
- 1 chip: `0x00001EB5` (e.g., Bitaxe, S21 Pro single chip)
- 77 chips: `0x0000115A` (S19k Pro)
- 110 chips: `0x0000141C` (S19XP Stock)
- 110 chips: `0x00001446` (S19XP Luxos)
- Full range: `0x000F0000` (experimental, searches full 32-bit space)

**How It Likely Works:**
While the exact mechanism is undocumented, analysis suggests:
- The value may define a stride/increment for nonce searching
- Combined with chip address to ensure non-overlapping ranges
- Smaller values for more chips ensure better coverage
- Values appear carefully chosen to minimize gaps in search space

**Example Theory:**
With register value 0x00001EB5 (7,861 decimal):
- Chip might test nonces at intervals of 7,861
- Starting offset based on chip address
- Ensures even distribution without collision

Note: The ESP-miner source notes this register is "still a bit of a mystery" 
and values are determined through empirical testing rather than documentation.

#### Starting Nonce Field
- Always set to 0x00000000 in practice
- Hardware automatically offsets based on chip/core addressing
- Software doesn't need to manually partition the nonce space

#### Practical Example: 4-Chip Chain
Consider a 4-chip BM1370 chain mining a block:
1. **Job sent**: Same job broadcast to all 4 chips
2. **Chip addresses**: 0x00, 0x40, 0x80, 0xC0 (64 apart)
3. **Nonce space division**:
   - Chip 0: Searches nonces where certain bits = 0x00
   - Chip 1: Searches nonces where certain bits = 0x40
   - Chip 2: Searches nonces where certain bits = 0x80
   - Chip 3: Searches nonces where certain bits = 0xC0
4. **Total parallel operations**: 4 chips × 1,280 cores = 5,120 simultaneous 
searches

#### Multiple Hash Board Distribution
When a mining system has multiple hash boards, the software MUST prevent 
duplicate work:

1. **Time-Based Work Distribution** (most common):
   - Each board receives work with a different `ntime` offset
   - Board 0: ntime + 0
   - Board 1: ntime + 1
   - Board 2: ntime + 2
   - This ensures each board searches a unique block variation

2. **Work Registry**:
   - Software maintains a registry tracking which work is on which board
   - Each work assignment has a unique ID
   - Nonce responses are matched back to the correct work/board

3. **Example**: Antminer S19 with 3 hash boards
   - Board 0: Works on block with ntime=X
   - Board 1: Works on block with ntime=X+1
   - Board 2: Works on block with ntime=X+2
   - Total: 3 boards × 76 chips × ~100 cores = ~23,000 parallel searches
   - Each searching a DIFFERENT block variation

4. **No Wasted Work**:
   - Every hash calculation is unique across all boards
   - Software actively manages work distribution
   - Hardware (chips/cores) handle nonce space division within each board

### Job ID Management

#### Purpose of Job IDs
Job IDs are critical for mining operation even though work is broadcast to all
chips.

1. **Asynchronous Nonce Returns**: Chips find and return nonces at 
unpredictable times
2. **Pipeline Overlap**: Multiple jobs can be "in flight" simultaneously:
   - Commands propagate serially through chip chains (milliseconds for 64+ 
chips)
   - Cores may still be processing old jobs when new ones arrive
   - Typically 2-3 jobs overlap during normal operation
3. **Work Identification**: When a nonce arrives, the job ID identifies which 
block template it belongs to
4. **Critical for Block Changes**: When a new block is found on the network:
   - Old work becomes invalid immediately
   - Nonces for old jobs must be discarded

#### Example Timeline
```
Time 0ms:    Send Job 0x00 (mining block height 850,000)
Time 50ms:   Send Job 0x18 (same block, updated transactions)
Time 90ms:   NEW BLOCK! Send Job 0x30 (mining block height 850,001)
Time 95ms:   Receive nonce with Job ID 0x00 → Discard (old block)
Time 100ms:  Receive nonce with Job ID 0x30 → Valid for current block
```

### CRC Calculation
- **CRC5**: Used for command/response frames
  - Polynomial: 0x05
  - Init: 0x1F
  - Calculated over all bytes after preamble
- **CRC16**: Used for job packets only
  - Polynomial: 0x1021 (CRC-16-CCITT-FALSE)
  - Init: 0xFFFF
  - Calculated over all bytes after preamble, before CRC

### Version Rolling and Midstates

Version rolling allows ASICs to expand their search space beyond the 32-bit 
nonce range by modifying the block version field.

#### How Version Rolling Works

1. **Search Order**: The ASIC searches in this sequence:
   - First: All nonces in the chip's range, using current version
   - Then: Increment version and search all nonces again
   - Continues until all allowed version values are exhausted

2. **Version Rolling Control**:
   - Version rolling is enabled via register 0xA4 (VERSION_MASK)
   - The chip internally modifies version bits as allowed by the mask
   - For BM1370, ESP-miner always sets `num_midstates = 1`
   - AsicBoost optimization happens internally in the chip

3. **Version Mask Configuration**:
   - Set via register 0xA4 (e.g., 0x1FFFE000 enables bits 13-28)
   - ASICs can only modify bits enabled in the mask
   - The rolled bits are returned in the nonce response
   - Reconstructed version: `original_version | (response.version << 13)`

4. **Search Space Multiplication**:
   - Without version rolling: 2^32 hashes per job
   - With 16-bit version rolling: 2^32 × 2^16 = 2^48 hashes per job
   - At 1 TH/s, exhausting 2^48 hashes would take ~78 hours

5. **Job Exhaustion**:
   - No explicit "work complete" signal from the ASIC
   - Mining software must send new jobs before exhaustion

#### Version Rolling in Multi-Chip Chains

In a multi-chip chain, version rolling works seamlessly with automatic nonce 
space partitioning:

1. **Each Chip's Search Pattern**:
   - Chip searches its assigned nonce range (based on chip address)
   - After exhausting its nonce range, increments version
   - Searches the same nonce range again with new version
   - The chip address ensures no overlap between chips

3. **No Duplication**:
   - Chip address bits embedded in nonce ensure unique ranges
   - Version rolling multiplies each chip's search space equally
   - Total search space: (nonces per chip) × (chips) × (version values)
   - Example: 1B nonces × 4 chips × 65K versions = 2^50 unique hashes

4. **Timing Considerations**:
   - All chips roll versions at different times
   - Faster chips may reach version 2 while others still on version 1
   - This is fine---no coordination needed between chips
   - Each chip's nonce+version combination remains unique
