//! Message types for source-coordinator communication.
//!
//! This module implements the return-addressed envelope pattern for communication
//! between job sources and coordinators (scheduler, test harness, etc.).
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ## SourceHandle - Arc-Based Identity
//!
//! `SourceHandle` uses Arc pointer equality for identity instead of explicit IDs.
//! Each `SourceHandle::new()` call creates a unique Arc allocation, providing
//! automatic identity without coordination:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let handle1 = SourceHandle::new("pool-a".into(), tx1);
//! let handle2 = SourceHandle::new("pool-a".into(), tx2);
//! let handle3 = handle1.clone();
//!
//! assert_ne!(handle1, handle2);  // Different Arc pointers
//! assert_eq!(handle1, handle3);  // Same Arc pointer (cloned)
//! ```
//!
//! ## Communication Pattern
//!
//! Sources send events through a cloneable sender they're given at construction.
//! They receive commands through a unique receiver. The handle serves as the
//! return address---coordinators store it when receiving events and use it to
//! route commands back.
//!
//! ## Message Flow
//!
//! ```text
//! Source                          Coordinator
//!   |                                  |
//!   | send (handle, NewJob)            |
//!   |--------------------------------->|
//!   |                                  | (stores handle with job)
//!   |                                  |
//!   |    handle.submit_share(share)    |
//!   |<---------------------------------|
//!   | recv SubmitShare                 |
//! ```
